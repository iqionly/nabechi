# Build Run Static Server
For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:

`npm install -g serve
serve -s build`

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -l or --listen flags:

`serve -s build -l 4000`

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

`serve -h`
